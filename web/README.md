# Interop for Web

## Hosting by yourself

Copy and paste `fonts` and `fonts.css` to your public directory, then include `fonts.css` from your website.

Then in your stylesheet, set `font-family` to **Interop** followed by other fallbacks.

```css
body {
  font-family: Interop, sans-serif;
}
```

## Using public assets

If you don't have a server, use the Interop hosted from GitHub.

Just copy and paste `fonts-public.css` to your project and set the font family as described above.
