The Interop font family is a combination of the [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) and Noto Sans KR. Hangul glyphs are sensibly downscaled and their thickness are elaborately adjusted. I handcrafted each weight one by one instead of instance generation. It supports eight weights: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold and ExtraBold.
