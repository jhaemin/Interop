The Interop font family is a combination of the [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) and Noto Sans KR. Hangul glyphs are sensibly downscaled and the weights are elaborately adjusted. Since I'm not a professional font designer and lack of font design skills, I handcrafted each weight one by one instead of instance generation.

**Support eight weights**

- Thin
- ExtraLight
- Light
- Regular
- Medium
- SemiBold
- Bold
- ExtraBold
